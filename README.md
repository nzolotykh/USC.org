*NOTES*

This is an *in-development* group project. Other team members are: Calvin Leung, Phoebe Lew, and Priyam Parikh.

This program will facilitate communication between University of Southern California's organizations and their members. For organization leaders, this will be a platform for managing the organization. The functionality will include membership management, RSVP system for organization's events, notification system, as well as a discussion forum for all members of the organization. For regular students, this will be a tool to search for and join organization that match their interests. They will also be able to stay updated with the organizations they are currently in by joining events, reading the organization's announcements, and finding contact information for other members.

The project is still in early stages, but it already includes a SQL database implementation, basic GUI, and elementary database-GUI communication.

*INSTRUCTIONS*

The main function is found in src/USCorg/USCorg.java. For best results, use an IDE environment such as Eclipse to import the project.
